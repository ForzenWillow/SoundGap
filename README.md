## Design Choices:
The design aims for an eye-friendly experience, incorporating a Neon City Theme with a color palette of dark/light purple, black, and pink. The interface is designed to be visually appealing during both day and night.

### The website simulates a small music shop with:

* 12 products in 5 categories, including a price filter.
* A review section where feedback is stored in LocalStorage and displayed dynamically.
* A gallery with interactive images that can be zoomed in, switched using sidebars or keyboard arrows, and viewed in slideshow mode.
## Extra Features:
* Employee Directory: The directory is not displayed by default but can be shown by uncommenting the Register part in App.vue.
* Dark/Light Mode: Though partially implemented, the button only affects the product section (product name and shopping cart).
* ToTopButton: Clicking this button will scroll the page back to the top.
## Notes:
There are commented-out sections for features that didnâ€™t fit the final design but can be uncommented for experimentation, such as the Employee Directory and the Dark/Light Mode and other stuff that was the starting plan for some objectives.
